# AccessMap

AccessMap is a web application for event map creation. Organizers can design interactive maps, generating a link or QR code for event attendees to view from their devices. These maps comply with parts of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 and allow coordinators to communicate available accommodations, in order to increase event accessibility and share layouts with attendees.  Currently, many local outdoor events and festivals rely on paper maps, which are inaccessible for many. Additionally, vendor information can be outdated or inaccurate. This resource allows event organizers to create an accessible interactive event experience.
